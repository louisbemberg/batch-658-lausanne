Step 1 - The menu loop 🎁
Start by building the main loop displaying the actions and getting user’s input:


> Welcome to your Christmas gift list
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> list
> TODO: list items
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> add
> TODO: ask user an item and add it to gift list
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> delete
> TODO: ask user the index of item to delete and delete it
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> quit
> Goodbye










Step 2 - List, Add, Delete 🎁🎁
Now let’s implement the simple actions (list, add, delete).

How do you model your gift_list?
Do you use a hash? An array?
Discuss that with your teacher before you start each action.










Step 3 - Mark an item as bought 🎁🎁🎁
We want to be able to mark any item as bought:

ruby interface.rb

> Welcome to your Christmas gift list
> Which action [list|add|delete|mark|quit]?
> list
> 1 - [ ] sockets
> 2 - [X] ruby book
> 3 - [ ] macbook pro
> Which action [list|add|delete|mark|quit]?
> mark
> Which item have you bought (give the index)?
> 3
> Which action [list|add|delete|mark|quit]?
> list
> 1 - [ ] sockets
> 2 - [X] ruby book
> 3 - [X] macbook pro







Step 4 - Find ideas on Etsy 🎁🎁🎁🎁
You are out of ideas for Christmas and you want to find inspiration from Etsy.
Add a new action idea to your menu (additionally to the list, add, delete and mark actions). Here is how this action could work:

What are you looking for on Etsy?
> Jeans
Here are Etsy results for "Jeans":
1 - Levis Blue Jeans
2 - Vintage Jeans
3 - Cargo Jeans Pants
4 - White Jeans
etc.
Pick one to add to your list (give the number)
> 2
"Vintage Jeans" added to your wishlist
