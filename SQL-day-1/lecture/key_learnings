why is CSV bad?

- need to convert data everytime
- CSV only stores strings
- hard to search
- difficult syntax
- everytime we save, we overwrite the whole csv
- many files
- can't query the database


Relationships:

1:N (one-to-many)
"An X has many Y"
"A Y belongs to X"

N:N (many-to-many)
"An X has many Y"
"An Y has many X"
=> WE NEED A THIRD TABLE TO DEAL WITH THOSE
=> THIS TABLE IS CALLED A JOINT TABLE


Schema editor Vocabulary:
TABLE NAMES = plural
FIELD NAMES = singular
PRIMARY KEY = id
FOREIGN KEY = singulartablename_id

SQL KEYWORDS:
SELECT - What i want to see
FROM - from what table
WHERE - filter
AND/OR - extra conditions on the where
GROUP BY - group data together
ORDER BY (ASC/DESC)- Reorder data based on a field

SQL ADVANCED:
JOIN tabletojoin ON "insert here the bridge equality"
