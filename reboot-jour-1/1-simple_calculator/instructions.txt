Background and Objectives
We will build a simple calculator capable of handling the 4 basic operations (+, - , *, /).
The program will ask the user for two numbers and one of the four operators in order to be able to perform a simple calculation
and display the result to the user.

Step 1) Dumb Calculator

> Enter a first number:
> 6
> Enter a second one:
> 8
> Choose operation [+][-][*][/]
> *
> Result: 48



Step 2) Make it loop!

> Enter a first number:
> 6
> Enter a second one:
> 8
> Which operation [+][-][x][/]
> x
> Result: 48
> Do you want to calculate again? [Y/N]
> Y
> Enter a first number:
> 55
> Enter a second one:
> 2
> Which operation [+][-][x][/]
> -
> Result: 53
> Do you want to calculate again? [Y/N]
> N


Step 3) Refactor the back-end and front-end in separate files
